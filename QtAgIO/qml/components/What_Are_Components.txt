SpinBoxFusion: SpinBox had a binding loop in it, that this fixed. Don't use it.
SpinBoxDouble: This can handle double values. Use it everywhere, unless you need the metric capabilities of the other variants, or the error warning in SpinBoXCustomized.
SpinBoxCustomized: Int s only (no decimals). Will warn you if you try to exceed the maximum / minimum value.
SpinBox M, CM, KM: All convert between imp/metric, no warnings. SpinBoxM can have decimals.
